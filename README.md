# Base64 Encoder/Decoder

A simple Base64 encoder and decoder project implemented in Zig. This is my first Zig project, and is intended to help me get used to the language. The specification followed is [RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648).

## Usage

Run the app:

```bash
zig build run
```

Run tests:

```bash
zig build test
```

Or just build the project:

```bash
zig build
```

The executable will be located in the `zig-out/bin` directory.
